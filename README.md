# BlueHost-Sign-Up

There's 2 things we need to do, before we launch the official website: **Web Hosting** (what keeps the site on the internet) and **Domain Registration** (the name/address of the site). 

Unfortunately, web developers/designers don't do web hosting, so we have to rely on third-party services/businesses for Web Hosting and Domain Registration and the client has to pay them. 

## Why Web Hosting and Domain Registration are important

Web Hosting and Domain Registration are like your property deeds for your site, so it's important that the owner of the website does this themselves, as they have ongoing costs and the site'll be in your name.

## Ongoing costs

**Web Hosting**: Roughly £100 a year

**Domain Registration**:

1st year: free in most places
Years after 1st year: £15-20 per year

Total ongoing costs: £115 per year

I'd recommend Bluehost as your Web Hosting, because in the 1st year, they give you a free domain and SSL certificate (what makes your site seem safe/secure to Google) and price-wise, they're affordable, compared to other Web Hosts. 

By having you do this rather than myself, it ensures you get the notices about renewal or issues with the account rather than needing me to act as a middleman to relay this information. This also ensures that you are in control of the accounts and you don't have to be concerned about unauthorised access due to users you aren't aware of.

Once you are done signing up, you'll receive a "Welcome"-style email from Bluehost. Please forward that email to me. It will contain passwords and log in information I need in order to upload files and set up the official website.

## How to set it all up (we can also do this together over the phone/Skype, if you prefer)

The first 3 minutes of this video shows step-by-step how to do things: https://youtu.be/xt5L5RoaE5U?t=28

I've also added a list of steps here, to make things even more clearer than the video:

1) Go to this link: https://www.bluehost.com/track/paz94/

2) Click 'get started now'

3) Select the 'basic' plan.

4) Click 'select'. 

5) Under 'new domain', type what you'd like your website to be called e.g. google.com.
I'd recommend ath-driving-school.com for 2 reasons:
- The hyphens make it more readable
- .com is a popular top-level domain, so it's less likely to be targeted by hackers and spammers. 

N.B. The video says the domain is free. It's free for the 1st year in Bluehost for a 36-month contract. If you get a different contract, it's not free. Also, domains after the 1st year cost £15-20 a year. 

6) After filling in ath-driving-school.com, select 'next'. 

7) Fill in the 'account information'. 

8) In 'package information', pick the 'account plan' that best suits you. The total price of the 'account plan' will be in 'hosting price'.

9) Make sure all the boxes in 'package information' are unchecked, so you don't get charged extra for anything. 

10) Fill in the 'payment information'. 

11) Check the 'I have read...' checkbox at the bottom.

12) Click submit.

13) Under the blue 'website' heading, click 'Install WordPress'

14) Click under 'domain' and ath-driving-school.com should come up. 

15) Click on ath-driving-school.com

16) Click 'next'

17) Under 'Site Name or Title', write 'ATH Cambridge LTD' or 'ATH Driving School'. 

18) Under 'Admin Email Address' and 'Admin Username', you can enter your email or my email.

19) Under 'Admin Password', choose a password we can both use i.e. don't use a password you would use for anything else.

20) Make sure the 3 checkboxes underneath 'Admin Information' are checked

21) Click 'next'

22) You'll see signs that WordPress is being installed e.g. 'Overall Site Progress... %'

23) Wait until the site says 'Installation Complete'

24) Click on 'view credentials here'

25) Send me a photo of the page, which contains the 'username' and 'password'
